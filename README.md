# Customer_Segmentation_using_KMeans_Clustering
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using
clustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide
customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests,
and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.

## Elbow Method
This method is used to find the optimal number of clusters.

So, here the optimal number of clusters is 5.
## Gender and Age Distribution
Gender distribution is represented using a bar graph and age distribution is represented using histogram.

## Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is represented using a Scatter Plot.
